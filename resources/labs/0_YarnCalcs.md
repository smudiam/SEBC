# Vcores adjusted
	More the vcores, multiple mappers and reducers can be launched
	
# Worker RAM adjusted
	
	Increasing worker RAM inclreases the memory allocated to node manager and hence memory intense applications can benefit.
	
# work load factor

	
	workloadfactor = vcores/spindles
	Increasing vcores increases workloadfactor
